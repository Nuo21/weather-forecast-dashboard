# <Week 6 - Weather Dashboard>

## Description

This is a wonderful weather app that allows the user to enter in a city and have their weather forecast populate onto the page. The forecast will include the current weather conditions such as the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the UV index. Another great thing about this weather dashboard is that the user will also be provided with forcast for the next 5 days as well! This will allow them to get an idea in advance as to how the weather for the week will be. This app also stores the user's previous searches into local storage and are displayed as buttons underneath the search bar. The user can click back to any previous searches and the weather for the corresponding city will appear again.
